    <h1>Dear Aye,</h1>
       <p>
        Lately I have been thinking everything that happend, trying to make sense of what was and whats not, I know my actions felt like I was unbothered and I wasn’t effected by it. but it did.
    </p>
    <p>
        I realize that the way I pulled away from you, and the way that I just want to let go, came from this belief that you didn’t really care about what was happening. maybe you did, that I just couldn’t see that in those moments, But in the moments that counted, your silence felt louder than anywords. And I was confuse and have no clarity about it. And those build up thoughts really made me assume things. I wasn’t rushing for anything, I just didn’t have something to hold onto on those moments. maybe the mixed signals was too much for me, or it was a sign of you. Maybe showing my bitterness through the act that It didn’t matter to me too.
    </p>
    <p>
        But honestly in those days I said that I will leave you alone, I was just forcing myself not to even bother you, that week did made me do things I was supposed to do, but in the back of my head I still wonder If your gonna even say something.
    </p>
    <p>
        I did regret doing it and in the other hand I don’t, maybe what I did hurt you, or made me feel bad on your end. But honestly doing that was a temporary peace of my mind. It’s peace but still war.
    </p>
    <p>
        Maybe it’s weird to see your repost about it, or I was late too see it, maybe if I did see it my actions where different? but it is done, and theres nothing we can do about it. But who could I blame for not knowing your account, but I guess im just not into those things.
    </p>
    <p>
        That I know you know what you did to me (unfriended/unfollow/blocked) that everytime I chatted you with things I know im not even in your mutuals, but weirdly you expect that I will just keep going, that the thought of my mind that It was a sign of yours. I’m not even rushing anything to happened, confuse and lost from it, makes you question everything.
    </p>
    <p>
        Maybe thats the real reason why I even doubt myself, maybe my bitterness and saltyness made me careless about everything about it, but knowing that your talking about to your friends about me and not even to me.
    </p>
    <p>
        It hurts cause you show you care about it, but don’t. maybe you thought I knew your account thats why your reposting those things, or maybe those repost wasn’t really for me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Maybe for you, you were really there for me, but honestly I’ve never even felt a thing. I’m not saying you should have, but a thing that I could hold onto something, that I know that It’s something and not just within me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Or I’m just stupid and those repost where really not for me, but honestly I knew that your repost that says “pano makakamove on e kung inaasar parin ako sa kanya” makes me feel that It was really me that your referring. (I did hear things)
    </p>
    <p>
        I did those actions cause of my lack of perspective about it. That it’s me being me that I act upon a situation that is given to me, or maybe its a one-sided perspective for the both of us. It’s the “ifs” for things that the thinking “if I saw”, “if I have” but maybe if it’s not given or if others don’t see those things like me would they act upon your timeline in mind? or maybe they would be just like me? you were seen by others, but just not me on that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
        But I guess It’s my thoughts that thinking that we are still friends, cause we are friends in our digital worlds, but in reality we are stranger on our owns, that it’s just a coincidence that our paths cross again.
    </p>
    <p>
        That the world we are in, changed, and we grew up, gain perspectives of life that the saying of Frank Ocean “wish we grew up on the same advice” hits me into reality that we are two individuals that have experience different things.
    </p>
    <p>
        Maybe the things you have told me was a reflection of the things that I do back then, and im not saying I didn’t do those things. But was I really that bad? that left me questioning everything that I even remember. Did I even do it to you?
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s weird to tell you that I’m sorry for the things that I don’t even remember, or maybe I just forgot those actions that was left from my past. And I owed karma for what I did back then.
    </p>
    <p>
        No, I’m not gonna say that I had a bad childhood or the people around me influence me to do those things. I did what I did. And maybe that those actions I did back then was the only answer to what was at those moments. Neither way, I am who I am.
    </p>
    <p>
        But honestly I was silently fighting my own battles that I didn’t even tell you about, the hustles that I do, that theres apart of me that maybe you would never even cross about. cause you shouldn’t, you don’t have to walk into my path to know everything about me. and I shouldn’t in yours, we are two individuals that have their own lifes. That we could only do is to understand each other. But I shouldn’t blame you cause I know you didn’t knew about it, and thats the point would you be there for me if I have told you those things? or If you have seen my struggles? But honestly I did try to tell you about it that my mind say that maybe it could have change anything. But it didn’t the silent was like talking to no one at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        I try to be calm about it, and be casual on things, that I didn’t even bother to even talk to you at school. Honestly I felt in that time that im just getting disrespected by all the things.
    </p>
    <p>
        Are you really avoidant or It was not really me? (I know you might not get this or you might.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Maybe you just didn’t tell me somethings, thats why you left me questioning everything. Maybe I did something that maded you act like that. But for the better of me I will stop assuming things.
    </p>
    <p>
        I know im guilty of showing that I was unbothered, at the day that those chocolates that was given back to me, that I saw you staring at me, that I acted It didn’t bother to me at all, that I was still smilling at that day. And the days that follow, but It did. those days that I didn’t have my answer was me doing stuff that make me feel like I was unbothered or weak from your point, that maybe at the time I didn’t understand It at all, or even until now, I still wonder what did things go wrong, or It was destined to fall from the start.
    </p>
    <p>
        And seeing your repost late, is a bit of a bittersweet of feelings, maybe im not just onto those things or rather im new from those things, but the feeling that you did cared about it gave me comfort or closure for my bitterness, honestly almost 2 months that things ended was my salt to not show you that I even need closure for what happened, but it did destroyed me that im just keeping my heads up. I know you know, when we cross those hallways, i’ll always never look at you.
    </p>
    <p>
        But on those days that I felt the burden of eveything, that I still had to keep moving even if the world is not even in my favor, but I kept my game up, showing that I’m not even carrying any problems within me. Sorry if those acts make you feel I didn’t care about it, but it did, It meant a lot, I just can’t show it. I dont want to be seen by those around me that im weak, neither I want to be seen by others to understand what I felt about it, or even from you.
    </p>
    <p>
        But honestly you meant a lot for me, not just a childhood friend, but something I was willing to take all the risks, I cherish every memory that I had with you. I was genuine about everything wanting to be something more, and being the person that will always have your back. Be the one who would laugh with you. And achieve every single dream. You’re more than words can explain. And I will never get tired writing this long paragraphs for you to read. Or maybe you don’t even read it. Who knows? your the one who could answer that.
    </p>
    <p>
        But maybe this time, it’s time to bringdown my bitterness for everything that happend, And maybe this time I will properly heal from it, im sorry if I didn’t follow your timeline in mind, and maybe getting your answer is a step forward for me to learn and grow, but i still can’t say that I just want you to be a person that is a lesson to me. Neither way that maybe I will have my own life and move on from this. But I will always remember that how my heart fell for you back in 2018 and maybe that the chance I took is the real answer for what life’s to come. I will always wish the best of you and what life comes upon to you. That I wish you godspeed and until our paths cross again. And advance goodluck sa UPCAT.
